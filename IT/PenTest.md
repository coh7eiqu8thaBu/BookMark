### Training
* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) - TryHackMe takes the pain out of learning and teaching Cybersecurity. Our platform makes it a comfortable experience to learn by designing prebuilt courses which include virtual machines (VM) hosted in the cloud ready to be deployed. This avoids the hassle of downloading and configuring VM's. Our platform is perfect for CTFs, Workshops, Assessments or Training.

## Search and Recon ...
### Web, SSL or SMTP analysis
* [Observatory by Mozilla](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) - Check HTTP/HTTPS
* [SSL Labs by Qualys](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) - Check SSL
* [Hardenize](https://www.hardenize.com/) - Check SMTP, HTTP and HTTPS
* [Cert Spotter monitors Certificate Transparency logs and alerts](https://sslmate.com/certspotter/) you when a digital certificate is issued for one of your domains. Better visibility means better uptime and security.

Additionally, the plugin�s functionality is straightforward to extend to accommodate any custom data encoding and decoding needs. https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2017/september/decoder-improved-burp-suite-plugin-release-part-1/ https://github.com/nccgroup/Decoder-Improved

## Exfiltration
* DET (is provided AS IS), is a proof of concept to perform Data Exfiltration using either single or multiple channel(s) at the same time. This is a Proof of Concept aimed at identifying possible DLP failures. This should never be used to exfiltrate sensitive/live data. The idea was to create a generic toolkit to plug any kind of protocol/service to test implemented Network Monitoring and Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) solutions configuration, against different data exfiltration techniques.

* Here is the description: "Project SAVE - Social Vulnerability & Assessment Framework - is an explorative study on cyber attacks using Social Engineering 2.0 and advanced open source intelligence (OSINT). Social engineering involves the exploitation of the human element of cyber security. The study is an investigation into the phenomenon of Social Engineering 2.0 with the aim of developing a social vulnerability assessment (SVA) framework for conducting cyber reconnaissance to uncover critical information and using deception tactics to create social engineering attacks, which will help identify the human security vulnerabilities within an organisation. In Project SAVE, a total of 185 social engineering attacks have been executed against three organisations that are part of critical infrastructure in Denmark. See the results of the attacks as well as the utilised attack vectors, and get insight into how cyber criminals utilise information from open sources to design personalised cyber attacks."

This allows an attacker to set up a page on the service that was being used and point their page to that subdomain. For example, if subdomain.example.com was pointing to a GitHub page and the user decided to delete their GitHub page, an attacker can now create a GitHub page, add a CNAME file containing subdomain.example.com, and claim subdomain.example.com.
