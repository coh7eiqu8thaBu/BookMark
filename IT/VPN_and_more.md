* Streisand sets up a new server running L2TP/IPsec, OpenConnect, OpenSSH, OpenVPN, Shadowsocks, sslh, Stunnel, a Tor bridge, and WireGuard. It also generates custom instructions for all of these services. At the end of the run you are given an HTML file with instructions that can be shared with friends, family members, and fellow activists. https://github.com/jlund/streisand
* VPN Pivot sends and receive a fully encrypted TCP/IP stack over TCP stream socket, then the peers forward it into the desired device/host. The attacker explores the internal network as he belongs to it within a local IP address taken from the dhcp server or statically configured. www.kitploit.com/2017/09/vpnpivot-explore-internal-networks.html https://github.com/0x36/VPNPivot

# WireGuard
WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it plans to be cross-platform and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.
